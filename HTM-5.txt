2.How to embed audio and video in a webpage?
-->To embed audio in HTML, we use the <audio> tag. Before HTML5, audio cannot be added to web pages in the Internet Explorer era. To play audio, we used web plugins like Flash. After the release of HTML5, it is possible. Syntax:
<audio>
    <source src="file_name" type="audio_file_type">
</audio>
-->To embed video in HTML, we use the <video> tag. It contains one or more video sources at a time using <source> tag. It supports MP4, WebM, and Ogg in all modern browsers. 
Syntax :-
<video>
    <source src="file_name" type="video_file_type">
</video>

4.Canvas and SVG tags
SVG TAG:
-->SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
-->SVG is used to define vector-based graphics for the Web
-->SVG defines graphics in XML format
-->Each element and attribute in SVG files can be animated
-->SVG is a W3C recommendation
-->SVG integrates with other standards, such as CSS, DOM,       XSL and JavaScript.
CANVAS TAG:
-->The <canvas> tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript).
-->The <canvas> tag is transparent, and is only a container for graphics, you must use a script to actually draw the graphics.
-->Any text inside the <canvas> element will be displayed in browsers with JavaScript disabled and in browsers that do not support <canvas>.
